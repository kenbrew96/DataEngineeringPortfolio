# 🛡️ Authorization to Operate (ATO): Maryland DMV Digital Transformation

## 📌 Project Overview
The Maryland Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) is launching an **online driver’s license renewal system** that must meet security and compliance standards before it can operate.

This project **implements the Authorization to Operate (ATO) process**, ensuring compliance with **NIST, HIPAA, and state cybersecurity regulations**.

---

## 📊 Risk Assessment & Compliance Standards
- **Regulations:** NIST 800-53, HIPAA, FISMA.
- **Assessment Areas:** Data encryption, access control, system monitoring.
- **Risk Categories:**
  | Risk Level | Category         | Mitigation Strategy |
  |-----------|----------------|---------------------|
  | High      | Unauthorized Access | Implement IAM & MFA |
  | Medium    | Data Breach Risk    | Enable AES-256 Encryption |
  | Low       | System Downtime     | Deploy Redundant Servers |

---

## 🛠️ Steps Implemented
1. **Conduct Risk Assessment:** Identify vulnerabilities in DMV systems.
2. **Implement Security Controls:** Apply access restrictions, encryption, and monitoring.
3. **Obtain Authorization to Operate:** Ensure compliance with security standards and get final approval.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- 🔐 **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** – Secure login system.
- 🔒 **Encryption (AES-256, TLS 1.2/1.3)** – Protect sensitive data.
- 📊 **SIEM & Log Monitoring** – Real-time security event tracking.

## 🔧 How to Run Security Checks

### **1️⃣ Conduct Vulnerability Scan (Nmap Example)**
```sh
nmap -A -T4 dmv.maryland.gov
```

### **2️⃣ Enable IAM Role-Based Access (AWS IAM Example)**
```sh
aws iam create-role --role-name DMVAdmin --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json
```

### **3️⃣ Verify System Logs for Security Events**
```sh
tail -f /var/log/security.log
```

### **4️⃣ Automate Compliance Checks in `risk_assessment.py`**
Create a Python script to automate security policy enforcement:
```python
import os

def check_compliance():
    os.system("nmap -A -T4 dmv.maryland.gov > security_scan.txt")
    os.system("aws iam list-roles > iam_roles.txt")
    print("✅ Security compliance checks completed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_compliance()
```
Run the script:
```sh
python risk_assessment.py
```

After implementing these security measures, the DMV system will meet ATO requirements and be approved for operation.

## 📊 Expected Security Enhancements
| Security Feature | Implementation Status |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) | ✅ Enabled |
| Data Encryption (AES-256) | ✅ Implemented |
| Continuous Monitoring | ✅ Active |

---

## 🏆 Key Skills Demonstrated
✅ **Performing risk assessments for government systems**  
✅ **Applying security controls to meet ATO compliance**  
✅ **Monitoring and mitigating cybersecurity threats**

## 🔍 Next Steps
🔹 **Automate security assessments using compliance tools (OpenSCAP, Nessus).**  
🔹 **Enhance logging with SIEM tools (Splunk, ELK Stack).**  
🔹 **Develop security training for DMV employees.**
