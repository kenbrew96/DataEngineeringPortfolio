# 🚦 Traffic Surveillance Logging (Washington D.C.)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of logging to track **traffic surveillance events** such as vehicle detection and speeding violations in Washington D.C.

## 📊 Dataset
- `traffic_logs.json`: Contains logs of traffic surveillance events, such as vehicle detection, speeding, and traffic jams.

## 🛠️ Steps Implemented
1. **Extract**: Extract traffic logs from `traffic_logs.json`.
2. **Filter**: Filters out the speeding events.
3. **Save**: Saves the filtered speeding logs into an **SQLite database** for further analysis.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **JSON** for log data.
- **SQLite** for data storage.
- **Python logging** for capturing log events.

## 🔧 How to Run
```sh
python system_logs.py

### Summary of Steps
- **Step 1**: Create a sample dataset (`traffic_logs.json`) for traffic surveillance events.
- **Step 2**: Write the `system_logs.py` script to extract, filter, and save speeding event logs to a database.
- **Step 3**: Update `README.md` to explain the workflow and technologies used in the project.
