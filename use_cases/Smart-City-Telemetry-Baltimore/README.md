# 📡 Telemetry for Smart City - Baltimore Energy Usage

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on tracking **energy usage** in **Baltimore** using data from **smart meters** installed across various locations in the city. By processing this telemetry data, we aim to optimize energy usage patterns and improve city-wide energy distribution, helping to create a more sustainable urban environment.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset, `baltimore_energy_usage.csv`, contains the following columns:
- `meter_id`: Unique identifier for each smart meter.
- `location`: Specific areas within Baltimore (e.g., Inner Harbor, Fells Point, etc.).
- `timestamp`: Date and time when the energy usage was recorded.
- `energy_usage`: Energy consumed (in kilowatt-hours, kWh).

### Example Data:
```csv
meter_id,location,timestamp,energy_usage
001,Inner Harbor,2025-02-01 08:00:00,150
002,Fells Point,2025-02-01 08:00:00,200
003,Mount Vernon,2025-02-01 08:00:00,180
004,Inner Harbor,2025-02-01 09:00:00,145
005,Fells Point,2025-02-01 09:00:00,190

2. Transform
Objective: Clean and aggregate energy usage by location and hour.
Method: Data is aggregated by location and hour to get total energy consumption during each hour for each location.
3. Load
Objective: Load the processed data into AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage for storage and future analysis.
Method: We use Boto3 (for AWS S3) or Azure SDK to upload the data to cloud storage.
🚀 Technologies Used
Pandas: For data transformation.
AWS S3 / Azure Blob Storage: For cloud storage.
Boto3: For AWS S3 interaction (or Azure SDK for Azure Blob Storage).
Python: For scripting the entire pipeline.
🔧 How to Run
Clone the Repository:

sh
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-city-energy.git
cd smart-city-energy
Install Dependencies: Make sure to install all required Python packages:

sh
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up Cloud Storage:

If you're using AWS S3, ensure your AWS credentials are set up:
sh
Copy
Edit
aws configure
If using Azure Blob Storage, set up your Azure Storage account and container.
Run the Telemetry Script: Execute the script to process the energy usage data:

sh
Copy
Edit
python telemetry_data_collection.py
This will:

Extract data from baltimore_energy_usage.csv.
Transform the data (aggregate by location and hour).
Upload the transformed data to AWS S3 (or Azure Blob Storage).
✅ Next Steps
Verify cloud storage: Check that the data is uploaded correctly to your cloud storage (AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage).
Next use case: Explore Data Warehousing for Smart City Transportation.
