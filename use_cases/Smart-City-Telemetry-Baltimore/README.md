# ðŸ“¡ Telemetry for Smart City - Baltimore Energy Usage

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on tracking **energy usage** in **Baltimore** using data from **smart meters** installed across various locations in the city. By processing this telemetry data, we aim to optimize energy usage patterns and improve city-wide energy distribution, helping to create a more sustainable urban environment.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset, `baltimore_energy_usage.csv`, contains the following columns:
- `meter_id`: Unique identifier for each smart meter.
- `location`: Specific areas within Baltimore (e.g., Inner Harbor, Fells Point, etc.).
- `timestamp`: Date and time when the energy usage was recorded.
- `energy_usage`: Energy consumed (in kilowatt-hours, kWh).

### Example Data:
