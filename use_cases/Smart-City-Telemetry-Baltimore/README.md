# 📡 Telemetry for Smart City - Baltimore Energy Usage

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on tracking **energy usage** in **Baltimore** using data from **smart meters** installed across various locations in the city. By processing this telemetry data, we can optimize energy usage patterns and improve city-wide energy distribution.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset, `baltimore_energy_usage.csv`, contains the following columns:
- `meter_id`: Unique identifier for each smart meter.
- `location`: Specific areas within Baltimore (e.g., Inner Harbor, Fells Point, etc.).
- `timestamp`: Date and time when the energy usage was recorded.
- `energy_usage`: Energy consumed (in kilowatt-hours, kWh).

### Example Data:
```csv
meter_id,location,timestamp,energy_usage
001,Inner Harbor,2025-02-01 08:00:00,150
002,Fells Point,2025-02-01 08:00:00,200
003,Mount Vernon,2025-02-01 08:00:00,180
004,Inner Harbor,2025-02-01 09:00:00,145
005,Fells Point,2025-02-01 09:00:00,190

## 🛠️ Steps Implemented
1. Extract
Objective: Pull energy usage data from the CSV file (baltimore_energy_usage.csv).
Method: We use Pandas to read and load the CSV data.
2. Transform
Objective: Clean and aggregate energy usage by location and hour.
Method: Data is aggregated by location and hour to get total energy consumption during each hour for each location.
3. Load
Objective: Load the processed data into AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage for storage and future analysis.
Method: We use Boto3 (for AWS S3) or Azure SDK to upload the data to cloud storage.
🚀 Technologies Used
Pandas: For data transformation.
AWS S3 / Azure Blob Storage: For cloud storage.
Boto3: For AWS S3 interaction (or Azure SDK for Azure Blob Storage).
Python: For scripting the entire pipeline.
🔧 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
sh
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-city-energy.git
cd smart-city-energy
2. Install Dependencies
Make sure to install all required Python packages:

sh
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set Up Cloud Storage
If you're using AWS S3, make sure your AWS credentials are set up:

sh
Copy
Edit
aws configure
If using Azure Blob Storage, set up your Azure Storage account and container.

4. Run the Telemetry Script
Execute the script to process the energy usage data:

sh
Copy
Edit
python telemetry_data_collection.py
This will:

Extract data from baltimore_energy_usage.csv.
Transform the data (aggregate by location and hour).
Upload the transformed data to AWS S3 (or Azure Blob Storage).

## ✅ Next Steps
🔹 Verify cloud storage: Check that the data is uploaded correctly to your cloud storage (AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage).
🔹 Next use case: Explore Data Warehousing for Smart City Transportation.
